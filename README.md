## Expect missing or broken features, many breaking internal changes, and lots of issues! I'm writing this from the ground-up with large goals in modularity and performance, it may take a while to finish!

‚ö†Ô∏è **WORK IN PROGRESS**  
WrenchBot is currently being re-written from the ground up. It's missing many commands and features. But, it currently has much more in terms of backend and guild functionality. Many things will change mid-development, as such things may break. Follow the [v2 project board](https://github.com/CraftLight-Network/WrenchBot/projects/3) for updates on completion.

‚å®Ô∏è **For developers:**  
Many of the modules made for specifically this bot work in other scenarios!  
This bot was made with modularity in mind, meaning many elements work elsewhere.
- TinyConfig
  - Only stores what it needs to for small file sizes.
  - Validates user input with options file to ensure security and ease-of-use.
  - Automatically migrates to newer versions for non-breaking changes.
  - Stores an infinite amount of config databases, no matter how large.
  - Easy to use with only a few amount of methods.
- TinyMigrate
  - Migrates to the latest TinyConfig version from any local version.
  - Metadata to specify changelog, versions, and breaking changes.
  - 3-step system: Parse (Convert data types, invalidate, etc.), remove, move.

## üîß Setup
1. Install the OS-specific build dependencies:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Pyhton](https://www.python.org)
- `GCC`/`windows-build-tools`
2. Install the run dependencies via `npm i` in the bots root directory.
3. [Create](https://discord.com/developer/applications) and [invite](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html) the bot. (Make sure to copy the bot token in step 7!)
4. Rename `auth-example.json` to `auth.json` and place your bot token in the "`token`" element.
5. Start the bot! Run `node .` in the bots root directory.
